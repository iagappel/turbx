# Examples

Examples for usage of `turbx` will be added in the near future.

## ABC Flow

here is some code:

``` python
import numpy as np
np.sum([1,2,3])
```

## $$f^{\beta}$$ Noise

Here is an equation to test $$\LaTeX$$-formatted math typesetting

$$e^{ix} = \cos{x} + i\sin{x}$$

Random noise is generated, its amplitude is scaled in the frequency domain by $$f^{\beta}$$, and then transformed back to the time domain.

``` python
import numpy as np
np.sum([1,2,3])
```
